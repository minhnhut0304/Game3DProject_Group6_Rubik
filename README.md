<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>For all of us, it is no longer strange to the game tic tac toe. Since I was still in school, I can play this game every time I have free time, it just needs a piece of paper and a pencil so that we can play this game everywhere every time. With today's advancements, we want to take this childhood game to the next level. That is to turn this game into 3D and make it on the Unity platform. This will make it easy for those of us who work with computers to relax with this game at any time.</p>
