Our objective is to solve the randomized, shuffled, messy configuration of the cube by rotating the faces, get back to the original solved pattern with each side being a single color. Rubik's cube is one of the most popular game and have beed played by a large number of people. We will have a 3D Rubik cube that can be rotated in the same way that a real Rubik cube can. The player can scramble it before attempting to solve this cube and win the game./p>
